## What is Sei Global Wallet?

Sei Global Wallet provides a unified wallet experience for your users by implementing the EIP-6963 wallet discovery standard. Instead of manually integrating dozens of different wallet providers, your application automatically detects and connects to any compatible wallet.

## Why unified wallets matter

Traditional wallet integration creates friction for both developers and users:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For developers">
    **Without Global Wallet:**
    - Integrate each wallet provider individually
    - Maintain separate codebases for different wallets
    - Update integration when new wallets launch
    - Handle different wallet APIs and quirks
    
    **With Global Wallet:**
    - Single integration for all compatible wallets
    - Automatic discovery of new wallet providers
    - Consistent API across all wallet types
    - Reduced maintenance overhead
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For users">
    **Without Global Wallet:**
    - Limited to specific wallet providers per app
    - Must switch wallets for different applications
    - Fragmented user experience across platforms
    - May not be able to use their preferred wallet
    
    **With Global Wallet:**
    - Use any compatible wallet across all apps
    - Seamless experience regardless of wallet choice
    - Freedom to choose based on features and security
    - Consistent interaction patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How it works

Sei Global Wallet implements the EIP-6963 standard for wallet discovery:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wallet announces presence">
    When a user has compatible wallets installed, each wallet announces itself to the browser using standardized events.
    
    <Info>
    EIP-6963 is an Ethereum standard that allows wallets to announce their presence without requiring manual integration.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your app discovers wallets">
    Sei Global Wallet listens for these announcements and presents available wallets to your users automatically.
    
    <Check>
    No hardcoded wallet list - new wallets appear automatically
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="User connects preferred wallet">
    Users can choose their preferred wallet from the automatically discovered options and connect seamlessly.
    
    <Check>
    Consistent connection flow regardless of wallet choice
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>
