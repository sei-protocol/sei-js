# Quick Start

Get Sei Global Wallet up and running in your application with a simple installation and import.

## Installation

Install the Sei Global Wallet package using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basic Integration

Import the package to register the wallet with the EIP-6963 standard:

```typescript
import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963';
```

<Note>
This single import enables Sei Global Wallet discovery across all EIP-6963 compatible wallet connection libraries including RainbowKit, ConnectKit, Web3-React, and more.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Sei Global Wallet, ensure you understand these key concepts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="EIP-6963 Standard">
    EIP-6963 is a standard that allows multiple wallets to coexist without conflicts. Instead of fighting over `window.ethereum`, wallets announce themselves through events, letting users choose which one to use.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Dynamic Infrastructure">
    Dynamic is the infrastructure powering Sei Global Wallet. It handles authentication, key management, and cross-app wallet persistence while keeping wallets non-custodial.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Supported Authentication Methods

Sei Global Wallet supports multiple authentication methods:

## Testing Your Integration

Once you've completed an integration, test it by:

1. **Browser Compatibility:** Test with multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Network Switching:** Verify connections work on both Sei mainnet and testnet
3. **Authentication Methods:** Test different social login options
4. **Persistence:** Ensure wallet connection persists across page refreshes

<Tip>
Clear your browser cache if wallets aren't appearing in the connection modal during testing.
</Tip>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sei Global Wallet doesn't appear in wallet list">
    **Solution:** Ensure the import is at the top of your main application file:
    ```typescript
    import '@sei-js/sei-global-wallet/eip6963';
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="TypeScript errors about window.ethereum">
    **Solution:** Add type declarations to your project:
    ```typescript
    // Add to your App.tsx or create types/global.d.ts
    declare global {
      interface Window {
        ethereum?: any;
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="WalletConnect connection fails">
    **Solution:** Get a proper project ID from [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) and replace `'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual ID.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
