## Build on Sei

@sei-js is the complete TypeScript SDK for building applications on Sei Network. Whether you're creating DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, or blockchain games, @sei-js provides everything you need to ship faster.

**Works with your favorite tools:** Sei is fully EVM-compatible, so you can use Viem, Ethers.js, Foundry, Hardhat, and all your existing Ethereum development tools without any changes. @sei-js extends these tools with Sei-specific features like precompiled contracts and optimized wallet connections.
