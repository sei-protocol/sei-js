## 🏗️ Create your first Sei application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    Generate a new Sei application using our CLI tool:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npx
      npx @sei-js/create-sei app
      ```
      
      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm create @sei-js/create-sei app
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Check>
    **Expected outcome:** A new project directory with TypeScript configuration, testing setup, and example code.
    </Check>
    
    <Info>
    The CLI will ask you to choose a template. Select "React + Wagmi" for a full-featured web application, or "Node.js" for backend/script development.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate and install dependencies">
    Move into your project directory and install dependencies:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      cd app
      npm install
      ```
      
      ```bash yarn
      cd app
      yarn install
      ```
      
      ```bash pnpm
      cd app
      pnpm install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Check>
    **Expected outcome:** All dependencies installed successfully without errors.
    </Check>
    
    <Accordion title="Troubleshooting installation issues">
      **Common issues and solutions:**
      
      - **Node version conflicts:** Use `nvm use` to switch to the correct Node.js version
      - **Permission errors:** Avoid using `sudo` with npm. Use `nvm` or fix npm permissions
      - **Network timeouts:** Try switching to a different registry: `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your development server">
    Launch your application in development mode:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm run dev
      ```
      
      ```bash yarn
      yarn dev
      ```
      
      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm dev
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Check>
    **Expected outcome:** Development server running at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload enabled.
    </Check>
    
    Your browser should automatically open to show your new Sei application with:
    - Wallet connection button
    - Network status display
    - Example interactions ready to test
  </Step>
</Steps>
