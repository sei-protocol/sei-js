## Installation

You don't need to install `@sei-js/create-sei` globally. Use it directly with npx or pnpm:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npx
npx @sei-js/create-sei app -name my-sei-app
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm create @sei-js/create-sei app -name my-sei-app
```

</CodeGroup>

## Interactive Setup

The CLI provides an interactive wizard to guide you through project setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the CLI">
    Execute the create-sei command with your project name:
    ```bash
    npx @sei-js/create-sei app
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Framework">
    - `cd my-sei-app`
    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn dev`

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Project Setup">
    The CLI automatically configures:
    - TypeScript configuration
    - Up to date NextJS

    - Biome formatting

  </Step>
</Steps>
