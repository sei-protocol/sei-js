## Overview

`@sei-js/create-sei` is a CLI tool that scaffolds production-ready Sei dApps in seconds. Choose from EVM or Cosmos templates with Next.js/Vite, modern wallet integration, and TypeScript support.

```bash
npx @sei-js/create-sei app -n my-sei-app
```

<Warning>
**Cosmos Deprecation**: Per [SIP-3](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-improvement-proposals/blob/main/SIPS/sip-3.md), Sei is transitioning to EVM only. Use EVM templates for new projects.
