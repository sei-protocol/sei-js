## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that connects AI systems with external tools and data sources. It enables:

- **Real-time data access** from external services
- **Function execution** and operations  
- **Context preservation** across interactions
- **Specialized capabilities** beyond base training

The Sei MCP Server leverages this protocol to bring blockchain functionality directly to your AI assistant.
