## Quick Start

<Note>
**Secure by Default**: The MCP server runs in **read-only mode** by default. Wallet tools are disabled until you explicitly configure a private key.
</Note>

### Basic Setup (Read-Only)

Start with read-only blockchain data access:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sei": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Full Setup (With Wallet)

To enable transactions and wallet tools, add the wallet mode flag and private key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sei": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "WALLET_MODE": "private-key",
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "0x123..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that connects AI systems with custom prompts, tools and data sources (context). It enables:

- **Real-time blockchain data access** - Get current balances, transaction history, and network status directly from Sei
- **Secure by default** - Runs in read-only mode until you explicitly enable wallet tools
- **Full execution and write operations** - Deploy contracts, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts (with wallet configured)
- **Up-to-date documentation access** - Search and understand the latest Sei documentation and guides
- **Specialized blockchain capabilities** - Access Sei-specific features like precompiles and native token operations

The Sei MCP Server leverages this protocol to bring comprehensive blockchain functionality directly to your AI assistant, enabling natural language interactions with the Sei network.
