## Quick Start

<Note>
**Secure by Default**: The MCP server runs in **read-only mode** by default. Wallet tools are disabled until you explicitly configure a private key.
</Note>

### Basic Setup (Read-Only)

Start with read-only blockchain data access:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sei": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Full Setup (With Wallet and optional RPC urls)

To enable transactions and wallet tools, add the wallet mode flag and private key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sei": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "WALLET_MODE": "private-key",
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "MAINNET_RPC_URL": "YOUR_MAINNET_RPC_URL", // Optional
        "TESTNET_RPC_URL": "YOUR_TESTNET_RPC_URL", // Optional
        "DEVNET_RPC_URL": "YOUR_DEVNET_RPC_URL" // Optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that connects AI systems with custom prompts, tools and data sources (context). It enables:

- **Real-time blockchain data access** - Get current balances, transaction history, and network status directly from Sei
- **Secure by default** - Runs in read-only mode until you explicitly enable wallet tools
- **Full execution and write operations** - Deploy contracts, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts (with wallet configured)
- **Up-to-date documentation access** - Search both main Sei docs and Sei-JS package documentation for comprehensive guidance
- **Specialized blockchain capabilities** - Access Sei-specific features like precompiles and native token operations

The Sei MCP Server leverages this protocol to bring comprehensive blockchain functionality directly to your AI assistant, enabling natural language interactions with the Sei network.

## Example Queries

```text
"How do I bridge tokens to Sei from Ethereum?"
"How do I query staking my delegations using Viem?"
"Generate a wallet connection component using Sei Global Wallet"
"Help me set up a new Sei project with the latest patterns"
```

## Code Generation

The AI generates accurate, production-ready code using official @sei-js patterns:

- Uses correct package imports and APIs
- Follows documented best practices
- Includes proper error handling
- References current version patterns

<Note>
The Sei MCP Server is actively developed with new features added regularly. Current version supports core blockchain operations with advanced DeFi integrations planned.
