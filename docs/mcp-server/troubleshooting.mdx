## Quick Diagnosis

Most issues are caused by an incorrect Node.js version being used. Start here:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Node.js Version">
    Verify your Node.js version is 18 or higher:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
    
    If you see a version below 18, you'll need to upgrade.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Your PATH">
    If your Node.js version looks correct but you're still getting errors, check your PATH:
    
    ```bash
    echo $PATH
    ```
    
    Look for Node.js paths in the output. If you see multiple Node.js versions, the first one in the PATH will be used. You can set the PATH [environment variable](/mcp-server/setup#environment-variables) in your mcp config to override what node version is being used.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Environment Variables">
    Check that your environment variables are set correctly. See the [environment variables](/mcp-server/setup#environment-variables) section for reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

### 'fetch' is not defined errors

This is the most common error and typically indicates a Node.js version issue. If the quick diagnosis above didn't solve your problem, try forcing a specific Node.js version:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Force Node.js Version">
    You can force the MCP server to use a specific Node.js version by setting the PATH environment variable:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sei": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"],
          "env": {
            "PATH": "/path/to/your/node/bin"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Replace `/path/to/your/node/bin` with the actual path to your preferred Node.js version.
    
    <Note>
    **Quick Path Finder**: Run `dirname $(which npx)` to get the correct path to use.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### NVM Version Conflicts

If you're using NVM (Node Version Manager), you might have multiple Node.js versions installed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check NVM Versions">
    Check your installed versions:
    
    ```bash
    nvm list
    ```
    
    Look for versions below 18 that might be taking precedence.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Option 1: Remove Problematic Versions">
    Uninstall Node.js versions below 18:
    
    ```bash
    nvm uninstall 16.15.0
    nvm uninstall 14.21.3
    # ... uninstall other versions below 18
    ```
    
    This will prevent conflicts with older versions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Option 2: Force Specific Version">
    Alternatively, you can force the MCP server to use a specific Node.js version by setting the PATH environment variable:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sei": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"],
          "env": {
            "PATH": "/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Environment Variable Issues

Many issues stem from incorrect environment variable configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Configuration">
    Verify your environment variables are set correctly. Common issues include:
    
    - **WALLET_MODE**: Should be `"disabled"` or `"private-key"`
    - **PRIVATE_KEY**: Must be 0x-prefixed hex string when using private-key mode
    - **RPC URLs**: Should be valid URLs if you're overriding defaults
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Configuration">
    Try running with minimal configuration first:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sei": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    If this works, gradually add your environment variables back.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reference Documentation">
    See the [Environment Variables](/mcp-server/setup#environment-variables) section for complete documentation of all available options.
  </Step>
</Steps>
