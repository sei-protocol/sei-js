## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses Yarn 4.7.0 with Corepack for package management. To get started:

1. **Enable Corepack** (if not already enabled):
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

The correct Yarn version will be automatically used thanks to the `packageManager` field in `package.json` and Corepack.

### Building

To build all packages and docs, run `yarn install` then `yarn build:all`
