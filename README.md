# SeiJS

SeiJS is a monorepo that contains multiple NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with Sei.

## Documentation

Please check [our documentation](https://docs.sei.io) for notes on how to get up and running. The tutorial has examples on how to connect to a Sei wallet, query an RPC endpoint, transfer tokens, IBC transfer, and interact with contracts.

You can also refer to the [typedoc documentation](https://sei-protocol.github.io/sei-js/) for reference on the contents of the @sei-js/core and @sei-js/react library.
