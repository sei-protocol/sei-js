# SeiJS

SeiJS is a monorepo that contains multiple NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with the Sei network.

## Documentation

Please check [our documentation](https://docs.seinetwork.io/front-end-development/javascript-tutorial) for notes on how to get up and running. The tutorial has examples on how to connect to a Sei wallet, query an RPC endpoint, transfer tokens, IBC transfer, and execute contracts.
