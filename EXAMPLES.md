# Sei-JS Javascript Reference
This document shows examples of common javascript interactions for Sei using libraries in the @sei-js repo.

## Getting Started 
Please review our [Getting Started](https://docs.sei.io/develop/get-started) page to set up your environment. 
We have created a sample project that has many of the most common functions needed while interacting with Sei. Cloning and running our [js-examples](https://github.com/sei-protocol/js-examples) repo is a great place to start for anyone new to Sei.
For additional helpful functions and components or to learn more about the functions used in this reference please see the [@sei-js/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sei-js/core) and [@sei-js/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sei-js/react) packages themselves.

## Connecting to a Wallet
In order to interact with Sei you must have a `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet` which can be accessed through a clients installed wallet extension, generated, or restored by using a mnemonic seed phrase.
