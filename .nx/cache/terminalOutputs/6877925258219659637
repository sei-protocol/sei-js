[33m  â€¢ `Math.random` was detected in the Snap bundle. This is not a secure source of randomness, and should not be used in a secure context. Use `crypto.getRandomValues` instead.[39m

[33m  â€¢ The snap attempted to use one or more Node.js builtins, but no browser fallback has been provided. The MetaMask Snaps CLI does not support Node.js builtins by default. If you want to use this module, you must set [1m`polyfills`[22m to [1m`true`[22m or an object with the builtins to polyfill as the key and [1m`true`[22m as the value. To disable this warning, set [1m`stats.builtIns`[22m to [1m`false`[22m in your snap config file, or add the module to the [1m`stats.builtIns.ignore`[22m array.[39m
