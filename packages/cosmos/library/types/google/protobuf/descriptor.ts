	 * A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which

	 * to be useful to IDEs, code indexers, documentation generators, and similar
	 * tools.
	 *
	 * For example, say we have a file like:
	 *   message Foo {
	 *     optional string foo = 1;
	 *   }
	 * Let's look at just the field definition:
	 *   optional string foo = 1;
	 *   ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
	 *   a       bc     de  f  ghi
	 * We have the following locations:
	 *   span   path               represents
	 *   [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
	 *   [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).
	 *   [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).
	 *   [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).
	 *   [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).
	 *
	 * Notes:
	 * - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
	 *   particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
	 *   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
	 *   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
	 *   have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
	 *   field without an index.
	 * - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
	 *   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
	 *   obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
	 *   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
	 * - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
	 *   example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
	 *   beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
	 *   the block.
	 * - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
	 *   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a "group" defines
	 *   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
	 *   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
	 * - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
	 *   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
	 *   be recorded in the future.

	 * For example, this path:

	 *   file.message_type(3)  // 4, 3
	 *       .field(7)         // 2, 7
